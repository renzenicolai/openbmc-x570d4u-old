#             For example, resetting the host reboot count could be put in
#             this target so on any fresh power on, this count is reset.
# - startmin: Minimum services required to start the host. This target will
#             be called by reboot and start target.
# - stop:     Services to run to shutdown the host
# - quiesce:  Target to enter on host boot failure
# - graceful-quiesce:  Target to enter on host boot failure (allow host graceful shutdown)
# - shutdown: Tell host to shutdown, then stop system
# - reset:   Services to check if host is running and update host "start" target
# - crash:   Target to run when host crashes. it is very much similar to
#            quiesce target but the only delta is that this target contains
#            multiple services and one of them is the quiesce target.
# - timeout: Target to run when host watchdog times out
# - reboot:  Reboot the host with a chassis power cycle included
# - warm-reboot: Reboot the host without a chassis power cycle.
# - force-warm-reboot: Reboot the host without a chassis power cycle and without
#                      notifying the host.
# - diagnostic-mode: This will be entered when the host is collecting diagnostic
#                    data for itself.
