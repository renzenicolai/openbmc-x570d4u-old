# To add another RMCPP interface, add similar lines to the

# ALT_RMCPP_IFACE = "eth1"
# SYSTEMD_SERVICE:${PN} += " \
#     ${PN}@${ALT_RMCPP_IFACE}.service \

# Also, be sure to enable a corresponding entry in the channel
# config file with the same 'name' as the interfaces above
# Override the default phosphor-ipmi-config.bb with a bbappend
