Subject: [PATCH] OPTEE Private Includes

Change the optee module includes to be private instead of public, so they don't get used
in every build, which can result in compile failures as /core/include/ doesn't exit.

For some reason this behaviour isn't deterministic, a ticket has been filed with upstream.
